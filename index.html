<h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
<div> it is a version control system. It is important because it allows multiple coders to work on the same file at the same time and allows each to push changes and keep track of the history of the project. </div>
<h4>What’s a branch and why do we create them?</h4>
<div>A branch is like a diversion from the main road that allows coders to test changes that can potentiall break the main code. Branches need not get implemented on the original work.</div>
<h4>What’s the working tree?</h4>
<div>The collection of files and folders in a repository is the Git working tree.</div>
<h4>What’s the staging area?</h4>
<div>The staging area is the middle-man between the local and remote repositories. Documents are first added to the staging area and then comitted once ready.</div>
<h4>What’s the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote serve?</h4>
<div>git pull origin master/main </div>
